          <p>The rough fabric covering my eyes could not hide the fact that I was presently being dragged across a pine forest floor.</p>
          <p>As if I would be able to see anyway, the air's chill was a continuous reminder that it was still night and the sun's warmth was far, far, away.</p>
  
          <p>
            My foggy mind began to return to me and I built up the courage to scream for help.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            "Quiet yourself, or I'll stop and kill you here" my assailant howled, exasperatedly.
          </p>
          <p>
            "If not me, them..." he then muttered.
          </p> 
          <p>
            I was confused, but not scared. I knew who I was dealing with, this was my mark. I had been hunting him for weeks, a man living on the outskirts of a wealthy rancher's land. 
            <br>He was a petty thief accused of stealing a few goats, and I was hired to make an example of <a href="/Feral_Ranch/part_2.html">him</a>.
