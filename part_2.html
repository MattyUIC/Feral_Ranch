      <h2>Him</h2>
      <p>"You know you have now committed a federal offense. I'm a Marshal." I lied.</p>
      
      <p>
        He said nothing.</p>
        
        <p>
          "There is a warrant for your arrest issued by the owner of this ranch, Martin Ferrell." I continued.
        </p>
        <p>He grunted and dropped me. Frantically, I began kicking my legs to try and get away, but his heavy foot stomped
          down on my sternum.
          <br>I gasped and tried to catch my breath but was knocked unconscious again.
        </p>
        <p>I awoke to screams. Guttural cries faded to drowning gurgles, then silence and the sounds of a crackling fire.
    </p>
    <p>Adrenaline coursed through my veins and I began to struggle. I quickly realized that now my hands were tied
      behind my back, to a tree.</p>
      <p>The sounds of snapping twigs and russling foliage triggered a new wave of anxiety and I redoubled my efforts to
      free myself. Out of all other options, I knew what I had to <a href="/Feral_Ranch/part_3.html">do</a>.</p>
